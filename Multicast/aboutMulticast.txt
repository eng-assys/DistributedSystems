# IP multicast is a method of sending Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams to a group
# of interested receivers in a single transmission.
#  It uses specially reserved multicast address blocks in IPv4 and IPv6. In IPv6,
# IP multicast addressing replaces broadcast addressing as implemented in IPv4.

# Using multicast to deliver messages to more than one endpoint at a time achieves
# better efficiency because the network infrastructure ensures that the packets
# are delivered to all recipients.

# Multicast messages are always sent using UDP, since TCP requires an end-to-end communication channel.
